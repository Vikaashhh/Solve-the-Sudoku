# 🧩 Day 78 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🧠 Problem: Solve the Sudoku | Backtracking + HashSets
### 📌 Problem Statement:
Given a partially filled 9×9 grid, fill it completely such that every row, column, and 3×3 box contains the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

## 🔍 Approach:
✔️ Backtracking with pruning
✔️ Utilized HashSets to track digits in rows, columns, and boxes
✔️ Smartly reverted state during recursion to explore alternative solutions
✔️ Focused on both valid placement and state rollback

## 🧪 Submission Stats:
✅ Test Cases Passed: 10 / 10

✅ Accuracy: 100%

🕒 Time Taken: 6.18s

🎯 Points Earned: 8 / 8

## ✨ Takeaway:
Sudoku teaches that structured brute force becomes elegant when combined with constraints and memory-efficient data structures. It’s all about intelligent recursion and minimal guesswork. 💡
